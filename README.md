# Alarm-Clock

Utilizing Python, I've crafted a versatile clock application boasting four primary user-selectable functionalities: Clock, Alarm, Stopwatch, and Timer.

**Clock Feature:** Immerse yourself in time-tracking with two distinct formats: the traditional 12-hour or the military-style 24-hour. Witness the current time in HH:MM:SS format, seamlessly synchronized with the system time.

**Alarm Feature:** Set custom alarm times, equipped with the added convenience of a 'snooze' option. Once engaged, the snooze function activates a 30-second countdown before resounding the alarm once more.

**Stopwatch Feature:** Dive into precision timing as our Stopwatch begins counting upward from zero, ideal for tracking elapsed intervals. Within this feature, users can pause, stop, or lap time. Opting to stop terminates the program, while pausing offers the choice to resume or reset the timer to 00:00:00. Lap functionality allows users to record multiple interim times even as the Stopwatch continues its progress.

**Timer Feature:** Effortlessly count down from a user-defined time interval. Upon reaching 00:00:00, an audible signal notifies users of the conclusion, enhancing time management efficiency.
